# Take-Home Test — Fullstack Development

## Objective

Develop an application composed of:
- Backend in C# .NET
- Frontend in Next.js
- Two frontends in Angular

The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in integrating multiple frameworks, managing authentication with sessions, and enabling navigation between different applications.  

You can use **hard-coded authentication and OTP values** for simplicity. The objective is to show the flow and communication between the apps via session cookies, not to implement full production-grade authentication.

## Project Structure

/backend-dotnet      → C# .NET API (authentication and session management)  
/frontend-nextjs     → Next.js Application (login and main hub)  
/frontend-angular1   → Angular Application (regular user)  
/frontend-angular2   → Angular Application (admin)  

---

## Expected Flow (Next.js → Angular1)

1. The user logs in through the Next.js app using phone and OTP (can be hard-coded).  
2. After successful authentication, a session cookie is stored.  
3. The user clicks “Resume Application” and is redirected to the Angular User App.  
4. The Angular app should recognize the session automatically without requiring re-login.  
5. The user clicks “Go Back to Home” to return to the Next.js app, remaining authenticated.

## Expected Flow (Angular2 → Angular1)

1. The user logs in through the Angular admin app using email and password (can be hard-coded).  
2. Create a simple admin dashboard showing a list of user applications.  
3. When clicking the first application, redirect to the Angular User App.  
4. In the Angular app, display:
  - A welcome message
  - A header indicating the Admin name  
5. The user clicks “Back to App” to return to Angular1, remaining authenticated.

Example:  
[https://jam.dev/c/e759c278-a8f9-409c-b282-5c20541d102c](https://jam.dev/c/e759c278-a8f9-409c-b282-5c20541d102c)

You do not need to use any predefined UI — the interface and text can vary.  
The main goal is to have multiple applications communicating with each other using the session cookie generated by the backend.

This setup will be deployed to Azure, protected by Cloudflare, and all applications will be served under the same domain.  
Your implementation should consider production constraints (e.g., same-site cookies, secure HTTPS setup).

Build the code to be simple and efficient, and include clear instructions on how to:  
- Run the project locally  
- Simulate authentication and session persistence  
- Test navigation between the apps (Next.js ↔ Angular ↔ .NET)

Organize everything in a single repository and provide the repository link upon completion.

Feel free to improve it as you wish, using Docker, Webpack, Tailwind, or any other tools and optimizations you consider useful.
